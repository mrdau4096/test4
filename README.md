# Test4 (the 4th test)
## _Simple 3D rendering/physics system created with Python and OpenGL_
### _(If I were you, I wouldn't expect too much from this.)_
I have created this as part of my Computer-Science Non-Exam Assessment project. The intention was to create a simplistic representation of a late 90s/early 2000s 3D FPS game, to learn the processes of 3D rendering and physics simulation. This was not created to be a 100% realistic depiction of reality in any way - compromises **have** been made. I intend to infrequently update this github repo, as I flesh out the idea more. Do not expect AAA quality from this project, this is my first foray into a 3D game. The latest release will be listed on the right-hand-side, with installation instructions within said page.
_**Thank you for visiting this page, and if you download; I thank you.**_

### All assets, scenes, UI, etc are non-final!
_They will change, in due time._
_(maybe)_
