/Scene data example (/ marks a comment, Blank lines ignored.)
/The formats for each datatype;
/' | ' seperates sections of the data, such as object type (first hex digit) and coordinates etc.
/Vectors, dimentions and coordinates must be in the format 'X, Y, Z'
/All textures are hex-IDs, seperated by a single forward-slash '/'
/Boolean Values are represented by T(rue) & F(alse), seperated by ':'
/Integers, strings and hex values are simply as they appear.

/Types of object (Usable in file);
/0, Scene-wide data, Sounds & skybox // Dimensions, Centre, bottom/side/top textures
/1, Player data & items // Start position, direction, boolean item have/not have
/2, Cube // Dimensions, Centre location, bottom/side/top textures
/3, Quad // TL coordinate, BL coordinate, BR coordinate, TR coordinate, texture
/4, Tris // TL coordinate, BL coordinate, BR coordinate, texture
/5, Static Sphere // Centre location, Radius, Texture
/6, Static sprite, decoration // Centre location, texture
/7, Item, gives something and disappears // Centre location, "what to give" (health, ammo), "how much" (amount), texture
/8, Trigger, Do "thing" when player touches (01 is prev. scene, 02 is next scene, etc.) // Dimensions, Centre location, Trigger-flag, bottom/side/top textures
/9, Interactable, Like a button for player to use // TL coordinate, BL coordinate, BR coordinate, TR coordinate, Trigger-flag, texture
/A, Movable surface, Could be doors or similar yet may also be replaced // Dimensions, Centre location, bottom/side/top textures
/B, Hostile NPC, fights back // Start location, Facing direction, type
/C, Physics-enabled Sphere, Ball that can roll // Centre location, Radius, Texture
/D, Physics-enabled Cube, Such as a box // Dimensions, Centre location, bottom/side/top textures
/E, Light object, Creates light at a point with intensity and colour // Location, Facing-vector, Intensity, Colour
/F, NPC path node // Location, Hex-ID, Connections (To other Hex-IDs)

/Types of object (Unusable in file);
/{16}, Projectile, Not supported in file, only used by player/hostiles // NO_FILE_DATA
/{17}, Explosion, Has a bounding box, and anything within is pushed away and "hurt" if possible // NO_FILE_DATA
